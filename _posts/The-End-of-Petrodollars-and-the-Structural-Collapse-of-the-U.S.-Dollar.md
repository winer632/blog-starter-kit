title: 'The End of Petrodollars and the Structural Collapse of the U.S. Dollar'
excerpt: 'On June 9, the longstanding oil and security agreement between the United States and Saudi Arabia expired without official renewal, signaling a potential end to the petrodollar system. Historically, this agreement had Saudi oil exports priced in U.S. dollars, with the U.S. providing military support to Saudi Arabia. Today, with Saudi Arabia potentially moving to sell oil in various currencies, including euros, yen, and yuan, the market foundation for the petrodollar is eroding. This shift is prompting other major oil producers and consumers, such as Russia and China, to consider non-dollar transactions, weakening the dollar's dominance in global trade. As the petrodollar system collapses, the global trade currency system begins to deviate from the dollar, leading to significant implications for U.S. inflation, interest rates, and the broader international financial order. This marks a pivotal moment in the trend towards de-dollarization and the rise of local currency settlements.'

Petrodollar: audi Arabia Ditching the Dollar Will Affect 3 US Sectors

On June 9, the long-standing oil and security agreement between the United States and Saudi Arabia expired, pending renewal by both parties. To date, Saudi Arabia has not officially confirmed the renewal of this agreement. While authorities and mainstream international media remain silent, Arab and Indian media have picked up the story. Regardless, things are changing, and nothing will ever be the same.

The petrodollar system has been on shaky ground for years, and it now appears to be at a breaking point. The global dominance of the U.S. dollar, as the leading international currency, is experiencing a structural collapse.

Saudi Arabia's petro-dollar exit: A global finance paradigm shift
https://www.tbsnews.net/world/global-economy/saudi-arabias-petro-dollar-exit-global-finance-paradigm-shift-875321

Since the advent of shale oil development, the United States has held the title of the world's leading oil producer for many years, while South Africa is the largest crude oil exporter, and China is the largest importer. In the global oil market, the energy and trade relationship between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, which has been complementary for half a century, has solidified into a competitive one. Meanwhile, OPEC+ and Russia's oil production decisions increasingly conflict with U.S. interests. On the other hand, major oil-producing and consuming countries like South Africa, China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, India, and Brazil belong to the BRICS group and are keen to support international trade with non-dollar currencies and local currency settlements. The market foundation for petrodollars is becoming increasingly fragile and unsustainable.

On June 8, 1974, the United States and Saudi Arabia signed the petrodollar and security agreement, stipulating that Saudi oil exports would be priced and settled in U.S. dollars, with the U.S. providing military equipment and security assurances to Saudi Arabia. With the petrodollar agreement shelved, the U.S.-Saudi security agreement requires renegotiation. Historically, the essence of the U.S.-Saudi petrodollar agreement has been Saudi Arabia's geopolitical security. Initially, this involved Saudi-Israeli security relations, and following the Iranian Islamic Revolution, Saudi-Iranian security relations also came to the forefront. Within the balance of the tripartite security framework, Iran and Saudi Arabia are both Muslim-majority oil states, while Saudi Arabia and Israel are U.S. allies. This has driven the U.S. to foster closer Saudi-Israeli relations, turning the triangular balance into a bilateral confrontation. However, last March, Saudi Arabia and Iran reconciled in Beijing, fully thawing their relations. After the Gaza war broke out last October, Saudi-Israeli relations have become increasingly strained, reverting to the inherent framework of the Islamic world versus Israel. Realistically, in the triangular relationship between Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Israel, both Israel and Iran have de facto nuclear capabilities, leaving Saudi Arabia needing to bridge this gap for its security. Hence, a new U.S.-Saudi security agreement must involve nuclear considerations, which is still under discussion and review. This indicates that without nuclear components, the U.S.-Saudi security framework cannot revert to its past form and may completely unravel.

All You Need To Know About Saudi's 'Departure' From Petro-Dollar Deal And Its Implications For US
Is Saudi Arabia's 'Departure' From Petro-Dollar Deal An End To US Dollar Domination? US Loses Dollar Supremacy

As such, both the market and security foundations of the U.S.-Saudi petrodollar agreement have eroded. The decision not to extend the agreement allows Saudi Arabia to sell oil and other goods in multiple currencies, including euros, yen, and yuan, prompting OPEC+ to follow suit. Recently, Russia announced a total ban on the use of dollars and euros in its market transactions. The global oil trade currency settlement system is fracturing into a dual structure of dollar and non-dollar transactions, signifying the major collapse of the petrodollar system.

Decoupling oil trade from the dollar implies that the strong dollar must compete based on market strength rather than maintaining an artificially set monopoly. The strategy of increasing production and exports from the U.S. and Canada to squeeze non-dollar oil powers like OPEC+ and Russia is political and lacks economic rationale and efficacy.

The expiration of the petrodollar agreement may weaken the dollar's dominance in global trade. If more oil transactions are conducted in other currencies, it could lead to higher inflation and interest rates in the U.S. This development might accelerate the trend of de-dollarization as countries seek to reduce their reliance on the dollar, highlighting the growing influence of emerging economies like China. The collapse of the petrodollar signifies a domino effect on the dollar's international monetary status.

Firstly, the global trade currency system begins to deviate from the dollar.

Not renewing the petrodollar agreement aligns with Saudi Arabia's broader strategy to diversify its economic alliances, reduce dependency on the dollar, and integrate more deeply into the global economy through various financial tools and digital innovations. This shift also reflects the growing influence of emerging economies and the evolving energy landscape, as concerns over global warming and advancements in sustainable energy technologies reduce oil demand.

The collapse of the petrodollar marks the end of the dollar's exclusive monopoly, with widespread currency alternatives emerging. Following this, transactions in raw materials and other commodities such as food, fertilizers, minerals, and metals will move away from the dollar. Although the dollar remains the dominant investment currency and indispensable in futures trading, a "currency gap" may develop between futures trading and physical transactions, with non-futures trade currencies deviating from the dollar.

US-Saudi petrodollar deal ends after 80 years: What are petrodollars?

Secondly, local currency settlements will rise significantly.

Local currency settlements help hedge trade advantages and local currency disadvantages, freeing many commodity trading nations from their currency weaknesses, stabilizing their trade and monetary situations, and enhancing their international monetary and economic strength. Historically, currency swaps originated in response to the Asian financial crisis at the end of the last century, effectively bypassing the International Monetary Fund's insufficient bailout guarantees and allowing for non-dollar rescue measures. Local currency settlements can be seen as an upgraded version of currency swaps, with no currency or amount restrictions, typically limited to trade partners, such as Indonesia's palm oil trade and Russia's natural gas and oil exports. In China's case, local currency settlements have already surpassed dollar settlements in international trade. As the largest buyer of Saudi oil, yuan settlements for oil imports will significantly strengthen the position of local currency settlements.

Thirdly, the demand for dollars in reserve currencies will decrease, potentially undermining the dollar's status as a reserve currency.

The dollar holds a dominant position in global reserve currency demand. Given the reduced demand for trade currency, the demand for reserve currency will also decrease, fundamentally affecting the dollar's international reserve currency status. As global trade growth no longer implies inevitable dollar demand growth, trade conflicts and frictions may lead to reduced dollar demand. The diversification of trade settlement currencies marks the long-term and permanent trend of "de-dollarization," signifying a structural shift in reserve currencies.

Fourthly, dollar assets will suffer from accelerating "de-dollarization," leading to long-term depreciation.

With reduced demand for dollars as a reserve currency, in the short term, there will be "surplus" dollars, meaning dollars squeezed out due to decreased reserve and trade demand, seeking new outlets. This surplus of investable dollars is one reason for the surge in prices of digital assets like Bitcoin and precious metals. However, this surplus will not necessarily lead to a long-term boom in dollar asset investment markets; instead, its negative impact may be stronger. For example, the U.S. Treasury, which absorbs significant international dollar reserves, might see reduced demand for U.S. debt due to decreasing international dollar reserve needs. Consequently, these dollars might move away from the U.S. bond market to seek higher returns or riskier dollar assets.

Especially with the expectation of lower U.S. interest rates, the surplus dollars might not push up dollar assets but could directly impact the foundation of dollar asset structures. Further reducing U.S. debt holdings and shifting to other categories of dollar assets could be more disruptive. The U.S. Treasury's early December launch of its debt buyback plan underscores this point, even as U.S. stocks took a hit from the debt market's volatility.

Fifthly, U.S. finances could suffer from the collapse of the petrodollar.

The half-century-old bond between petrodollars and U.S. Treasury bonds may be severed. Not only will U.S. debt holders change the maturity structure of their holdings, replacing long-term debt with short-term debt, but the total holding volume may also decrease due to expected interest rate cuts. Crucially, the source of dollars for purchasing U.S. debt will shrink as petrodollars decline, potentially leading to historical shrinkage or even termination. The dollar's monetary base detachment from oil is a fundamental trend, which cannot be mitigated even with the U.S. as the largest oil producer. With U.S. debt reaching $35 trillion and annual interest payments hitting $1 trillion, the shrinking petrodollar, though not a critical support force for U.S. debt, is still a significant destabilizing factor for the towering U.S. debt.

Holding U.S. debt may not ensure the currency stability of trade surplus countries. For Eurodollars, the decline of petrodollars serves as a striking demonstration that the dividend model tied to U.S. federal finances may historically end. This will not help the U.S. bridge its fiscal deficit, stabilize the dollar, or relieve pressure on U.S. debt interest rates, forcing them upward.

Finally, the dollar may enter a controlled depreciation channel.

With the petrodollar heading towards a historical end, some critics mock that the only things supporting the dollar now are hope, dreams, unicorns, and lies. Worse than the dollar's devaluation is the deliberate disregard for this depreciation, leading to a loss of control. The petrodollar's decline and end could help manage the dollar's depreciation and enhance its ability to refinance national debt at lower interest rates. Without dominating broad geopolitical trends or overcoming sharp conflicts, the dollar must adapt. Entering a controlled depreciation channel is crucial for the adjustment of the global financial order, with far-reaching impacts.

Petrodollar: audi Arabia Ditching the Dollar Will Affect 3 US Sectors
https://watcher.guru/news/petrodollar-saudi-arabia-ditching-the-dollar-will-affect-3-us-sectors

In 2023, nearly 80% of global oil sales were priced in dollars, with 20% purchased in other currencies. Countries like Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia

, and China increasingly use local currencies in energy trade. As the petrodollar quietly fades away, achieving controlled dollar depreciation can help manage global inflation, rising interest rates, and bond market weakness, avoiding a repeat of the Great Depression over 80 years ago.

Unlike over 50 years ago, oil is no longer an invincible economic weapon, and energy alternatives are emerging. Similarly, the dollar can no longer be weaponized indefinitely, as currency alternatives are also taking place. Saudi Arabia is not the instigator of all this; strategically, it maintains bilateral relations with the U.S., and the Saudi riyal remains pegged to the dollar. In other words, as the petrodollar quietly disappears, Saudi Arabia still needs the dollar to support its currency. The question remains: what will happen to Saudi Arabia's substantial dollar assets?
