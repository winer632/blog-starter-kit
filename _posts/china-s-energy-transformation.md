title: 'China’s Energy Transformation'
excerpt: 'Oil is a crucial import and a national strategic resource for China. This article explores the main application scenarios of oil and highlights the significant role automobiles play in its consumption. Specifically, automobiles account for approximately 42% of China’s total oil consumption, which includes both crude and refined products. Given this substantial share, a comprehensive switch to electric vehicles (EVs) in the automotive industry is pivotal to China’s energy transition strategy. This shift is not only vital for reducing dependence on imported oil but also aligns with China’s goals for achieving peak carbon emissions and carbon neutrality in the coming decades​ (Council on Foreign Relations)​​ (CGTN)​.'

# People say that oil is an important import item and a national strategic resource. What are the main application scenarios of oil?

Oil is a crucial resource for various sectors due to its versatility and energy density. Its primary application scenarios include:

Transportation:

Fuel: Oil is refined into gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel, powering cars, trucks, airplanes, ships, and trains.
Lubricants: Various oils and greases derived from crude oil are used to lubricate engines and machinery.
Energy Production:

Electricity Generation: Oil-fired power plants generate electricity, especially in regions where other energy sources are less accessible.
Heating: Oil is used in furnaces and boilers for heating buildings and industrial facilities.
Industrial Uses:

Chemical Feedstock: Oil is a key raw material in the petrochemical industry, producing plastics, synthetic rubber, fertilizers, pesticides, solvents, and pharmaceuticals.
Manufacturing Processes: Various industries use oil-derived products as part of their manufacturing processes, including the production of asphalt for road construction and bitumen for roofing materials.
Agriculture:

Fuels: Diesel and gasoline power agricultural machinery and equipment.
Chemicals: Oil derivatives are used to make fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides.
Consumer Goods:

Plastics: Many consumer products, from packaging to electronics, are made from petrochemicals.
Textiles: Synthetic fibers such as polyester, nylon, and acrylic are produced from oil derivatives.
Defense and National Security:

Military Operations: Oil fuels military vehicles, aircraft, ships, and equipment.
Strategic Reserves: Countries maintain strategic petroleum reserves to ensure a stable supply during crises.
Aviation:

Jet Fuel: A specific type of refined oil, jet fuel, powers commercial and military aircraft, crucial for global transportation and logistics.
Marine Industry:

Bunker Fuel: Large ships and tankers use heavy fuel oil known as bunker fuel for propulsion and power generation.
These diverse applications highlight the critical role of oil in modern economies and societies, underpinning transportation, energy production, industrial manufacturing, agriculture, and national security.

# What are the top five imports of China by value? What is the ranking of China's imported oil in terms of value among all imports?

As of 2024, China's top five imports by value are:

Integrated Circuits: Vital for electronics and technology manufacturing.
Crude Petroleum: Essential for energy and transportation sectors.
Iron Ore: Crucial for steel production.
Petroleum Gas: Used for energy and industrial processes.
Motor Vehicles: Imported for both consumer and commercial use.
Among these, crude petroleum ranks second in terms of import value, underscoring its importance as a national strategic resource​ [The Observatory of Economic Complexity](https://oec.world/en/profile/country/chn) .

# What percentage of China's total imported gasoline is used by fuel-powered vehicles?

Approximately 80% of China's total refined oil consumption is used by fossil-fuel-powered vehicles. This includes gasoline, diesel, and other petroleum products used for transportation purposes. Automobiles account for about 42% of China's total oil consumption​ [Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/blog/fossil-fuel-free-plan-phase-out-chinas-icevs)​. Despite the rapid growth of the electric vehicle (EV) market, the majority of vehicles in China are still powered by internal combustion engines, which rely heavily on imported gasoline and other petroleum products​ [CGTN](https://news.cgtn.com/news/2022-03-29/China-s-new-energy-vehicle-industry-Where-are-we-now-and-where-to-go-18N7HvLZqpy/index.html)​​ [Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/blog/fossil-fuel-free-plan-phase-out-chinas-icevs).

# Approximately 80% of China's total refined oil consumption is used by fossil-fuel-powered vehicles. This includes gasoline, diesel, and other petroleum products used for transportation purposes. Automobiles account for about 42% of China's total oil consumption​​. Are these two sentences contradictory?

The two sentences do not appear to be contradictory but rather complementary, as they describe different aspects of China's oil consumption.

First Sentence: "Approximately 80% of China's total refined oil consumption is used by fossil-fuel-powered vehicles. This includes gasoline, diesel, and other petroleum products used for transportation purposes."

This sentence states that out of all the refined oil products consumed in China, about 80% are used by vehicles. This encompasses all types of refined petroleum products like gasoline, diesel, and others that power various transportation modes.
Second Sentence: "Automobiles account for about 42% of China's total oil consumption."

This sentence indicates that 42% of China's overall oil consumption, not just refined oil, is used by automobiles specifically. This includes crude oil and refined products used in the automotive sector.
In essence, the first sentence addresses the consumption of refined oil by all types of vehicles, while the second sentence narrows the focus to automobiles' share of total oil consumption, including crude oil. Together, they provide a detailed picture of how oil is used within the transportation sector in China.
